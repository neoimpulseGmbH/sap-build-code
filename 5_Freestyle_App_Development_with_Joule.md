# 5. Freestyle App Development with Joule

Joule claims it can even help us build *freestyle* apps.  
So… let’s find out.

Now we’re venturing into uncharted territory — best experienced first-hand.  
We’ll do our best to keep you (and your app) alive during the ride, but hey… no promises.

## 🚀 Create a New UI App

In this part, we’ll create a new Page XML file just to mess around a bit.  
But first — we need a fresh app to play with:

1. Run the command `/add-ui` and reference `#app/service.cds` using this prompt:  
   **_Add a UI freestyle page that lists all leads in a table._**

2. Check what Joule whipped up for you. You should see a shiny new app folder.  
   Got a Page XML in there? Great!  
   No? Alright, time for plan B — we’ll try a different command.

## 🎉 Conclusion & Next Steps

Congratulations — you made it through the wilderness!  
Here’s what Joule *can* do for you:

- **🚀 Accelerate Project Setup:** Instantly scaffold new apps from natural language prompts.  
- **🛠️ Streamline Enhancements:** Add features and logic to existing applications.  
- **🎨 Support Freestyle Development:** Help build UI components and handle interactions.

And here’s what it *still* can’t do (yet):

- **💬 Chat:** Joule doesn’t talk.  
  You can’t talk to Joule.  
  (But we can dream.)

We encourage you to explore Joule's capabilities further in your own projects. The more you interact with it and provide clear, precise prompts, the more valuable it becomes.
