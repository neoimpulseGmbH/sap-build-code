5. Enter Project Details
* **Project Name:** Enter a meaningful name for your application (e.g., `UserName_Leads`).
* **Project Description:** Provide a short description (e.g., `A app for lead creation`).
* **Dev Space:** For our example we are going to use the existing **Full_Stack** space.

7. Review your project **summary** and press create

Info: Creating a project might take a while, it can take up to 1 minute.

## Inspect project

When you view the project details again you will see that you are able to version it and add members to your project in order to collaborate. We do not need to change anything for now. 

Please recognise the state of the **Dev Space** after your creation it should be **Running**.  It needs to be **Running** in oder to access it via BAS.

## Connect to a Repository (Not part of this workshop)

For better version control and collaboration, you can link your project to a Git repository.

As we are not going to keep your project, we are not connecting to any remote-/repository such as AzureDevops or Github.
